	The question of the difference between Docker and Vagrant comes down to the fundamental differences between containerization and virtualization. Vagrant is a “virtualization management” tool – it can create and manage the configurations of many virtual machines. Virtualization provides the ability to mirror the user experience exactly, based on any configuration of any operating system. It provides strong security because virtual machines running on a single set of hardware are unaware of each other. (A bare metal hypervisor allots the hardware resources.) Benefits of virtualization include the ability to interact with a machine through its standard graphical user interface, and the availability of the full suite of tools that are typically provisioned with the OS. (Minimal versions ISO files are also often available with a stripped-down tool set to allow running on a less powerful host, or increase performance particularly if more than one VM needs to run on one host simultaneously.) However, there are drawbacks to using virtualization as well. Each machine consumes a subset of the available resources of the host, and modern operating systems typically require several GBs alone. Additionally, because of the underlying costs, spinning up the machines can take much longer than starting a container. <br/>
Docker is a “containerization” tool. Rather than spinning up machines that each run their own operating system, Docker can run multiple applications on a single OS, which significantly reduces the burden on the host, particularly when multiple containers are needed simultaneously. Docker containers are intended to perform specific functions, and it’s common to run multiple simultaneously (often integrated together to form a pipeline). Docker is also limited to running containers on Linux machines (where Vagrant can be called from any host that also has a Virtual Machine software, like VirtualBox, available). 
Vagrant and Docker do share similarities as well. Both allow for configuration of resources allotted to the box / container. Both support collaboration. Vagrant manages configurations that can be shared to the cloud and implemented on a developer’s local VM. Docker packages applications into containers whose images can be shared on Docker Hub. <br/>
Personally, I think I should prefer Docker over Vagrant for its lightweight implementation, and because it’s a more modern tool with a lot of flexibility. (Incidentally, Docker is used on many teams at my company, so I’m interested to become more comfortable using it.) However, I’ve had two experiences so far that are leading me in the reverse direction. <br/>
First, I’ve had some difficulty getting Docker containers running easily. I have successfully gotten them running to complete assignments, but I’ve also caused some issues with them (trying out other features) and have caused some issues. I do find it somewhat difficult (I’m sure because I’m still a novice and not super adept with the terminal) to see exactly what is happening in the container without a GUI to assist. <br/>
Second, I’ve struggled significantly with VirtualBox on Windows 11 because of the new security features related to the Hyper-V hypervisor. Because of this, I would expect that Vagrant would run very slowly as well. However, my experience has been the opposite, and in fact, the VM I spun up using Vagrant ran significantly faster than my previous VMs (possibly because of the ability to run without starting the GUI). Vagrant really came in to save the day when I was struggling with some permission errors on a tomcat server. So, at this point, Vagrant has been helpful in a pinch, but I’m looking forward to using Docker more!
